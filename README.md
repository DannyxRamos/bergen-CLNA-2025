## Perkins V CLNA Stakeholder Presentation

I co-facilitated a remote stakeholder presentation as part of Bergen Community College’s 2nd Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA) for the current Perkins V grant cycle. This presentation was part of a collaborative effort between the Center for Institutional Effectiveness (CIE) and the college’s grants office.

### Purpose
The session aimed to:
- Share Bergen’s overall performance on Perkins V standards with internal and external stakeholders
- Gather stakeholder feedback on how to strengthen support for special populations, with a focus on equity and diversity
- Engage stakeholders in identifying opportunities to improve CTE program alignment with community and workforce needs

### My contributions
- Co-facilitated the virtual presentation and guided stakeholder discussions
- Integrated topics, strategies, and best practices learned at the **2025 NACTEI National Perkins Leadership Conference** (*CTE: Where Legends Are Born*, Tucson, Arizona)
- Helped connect national policy updates and innovations to Bergen’s local CLNA process
- Supported documentation of stakeholder feedback for inclusion in the official CLNA report
