## Perkins V CLNA Stakeholder Presentation

I co-facilitated a remote stakeholder presentation as part of Bergen Community Collegeâ€™s 2nd Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA) for the current Perkins V grant cycle. This presentation was part of a collaborative effort between the Center for Institutional Effectiveness (CIE), the collegeâ€™s grants office, and external partners.

### Purpose
The presentation aimed to:
- Share Bergenâ€™s overall performance on Perkins V standards with internal and external stakeholders
- Collect feedback on how to strengthen support for special populations, with a focus on equity and diversity
- Engage stakeholders in identifying opportunities to improve CTE program alignment with workforce needs

### My contributions
- Co-facilitated the stakeholder meeting, guiding discussions and gathering input
- Integrated strategies and best practices learned from the **2025 NACTEI National Perkins Leadership Conference** (*CTE: Where Legends Are Born*, Tucson, AZ), including a workshop led by an Ohio representative on CLNA implementation
- Brought forward ideas from Ohioâ€™s CLNA guidebook and stakeholder engagement model to enhance Bergenâ€™s approach
- Helped document stakeholder input for inclusion in the CLNA report and Perkins V application
